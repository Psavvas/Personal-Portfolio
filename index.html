                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I’m a 9th grader at the Great Mills High School STEM academy. I have a passion for learning, innovating and push myself. No matter how hard the endeavor is, I’m ready to persevere and achieve them. After all lofty endeavors are proof of our ambitions. As a natural leader, I’m always ready to lead, help and support others. I love to design with CAD, code and create amazing inventions. I’m a firm believer in organization and using and effective GTD strategy.</p>
                    <p>I believe in a few basic principles. Firstly, failure is the first step to success. We all make mistakes and that's human. It's what we do with our failures. Whether we give up or use them to improve next time that determines us potential. Secondly, it’s never too late to learn. I believe that anyone can learn at any age, which is why I strive to always improve, whether that’s improving my coding skills or improving my writing skills. Lastly, I believe that an open mindset is key to making change in the world and improving. Only if we are open to accepting our mistakes and failures can we improve and get better.</p>

You can check out all my public models on my <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/Paul%20S.">Thangs </a>profile.</p>
                    <p><strong>Coding<br/><br/></strong>While I may not be a professional, I certainly don’t mind learning. I know how to code in HTML, Python and the basic of C++. Learning is an ongoing journey, and I’m always ready to learn more code. You can view my GitHub profile by clicking <a href="https://github.com/Psavvas">here</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tinkering<br/><br/></strong>I can’t resist a nerdy engineering session, to build something from scratch or with some inspiration from the web. Whatever materials are available, I’m always ready to solve a problem and build something amazing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Video and Photo Editing<br/><br/></strong>Making a masterpiece with photos and videos is always an amazing feeling. I love creating beautiful works, in the realm of digital art, whether that may be enhancing a photo or making a memory movie from an amazing vacation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Violin<br/><br/></strong>In my free time, I also like playing violin. I currently take private classes to further enhance and improve my playing skills.</p>

I believe that reading unlocks a whole new universe of adventures and potential. Reading is an amazing tool, and once one knows how to use it, the possibilities are endless.</p>
                    <p><strong>Traveling<br/><br/></strong>There is nothing better in my opinion that expanding my horizons. Traveling gives the opportunity to visit new places, with new cultures, languages and foods. It's an amazing way to explore the world and learn about the diverse cultures of the world.</p>

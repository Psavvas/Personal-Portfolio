                In this investigation, different internal structures of 3D printed objects were evaluated to optimize their shock absorption capabilities. These prototypes were each three inches thick and tested at collision speed of 6.82 mph. To test them, a pendulum-like device was created where an arm would swing and hit the prototype at a constant speed and force. Each design was also tested five times, with their averages being calculated. A Mass-Force Index (Prototype Mass x Max Force) and a Mass-Deceleration Index (Prototype Mass x Max Deceleration x -1) were created to compare designs. A lower output was favorable since it would indicate the design would be lightweight and cheap all while exhibiting good shock absorption properties. Furthermore, the prototype would have to prevent the testing arm from penetrating the prototype completely and yield an impact force and deceleration below 250 N and â€“245 m/sÂ² (â€“25G) respectively.</p>
                <br>
                <p> A series of prototypes were tested including a standard hexagon, zigzag, thin-hexagon and a combination of a zigzag and hexagon design. During the conclusion it was determined the standard hexagon was the most favorable with Indexes. However, this investigation proved that it is difficult to create a standard shock absorber optimized for every situation. Every situation is different with unique needs, the design that was proven optimal was only optimal based on the testing specifications put in place. Furthermore, a series of errors could have impacted on the results including print discrepancies and temperature & humidity impacting both the prototypes properties and the measuring devices.</p>
